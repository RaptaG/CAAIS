 The **Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script** (or _CAAIS_ for short) is a program (written in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)) which allows you to install and remove Chaotic-AUR **automatically** inside your system! It is based on the commands provided by [the Chaotic-AUR website](https://aur.chaotic.cx), including more functions and features!

Remember, Chaotic-AUR, like the AUR (Arch User Repository), is availiable **only** on Arch based Linux distributions.

## Installation

This will make it executable (working).

### 2. By cloning the source code (possibly unstable)

- Open a terminal and run the command below. This will download the script and make it executable:

```
curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaptaG/CAAIS/main/CAAIS && chmod +x CAAIS
```

## Usage

Open up a terminal inside the folder where CAAIS is installed and run one of the following, according to what you want to do:

```
sudo ./CAAIS -h or --help:            Display the help menu
sudo ./CAAIS -a or --about:           Display info related to CAAIS
