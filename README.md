# Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script (CAAIS)
<div align="left">

## What's that?
The _Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script_ (or _CAAIS_ for short) is a program which installs **automatically** Chaotic-AUR! It is based on the commands provided by [the Chaotic-AUR website](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) and does pretty much everything that is shown there.

## Usage
  
You'll need to download the script, make executable and run it. You can do this by just run the command below:
```
  curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaptaG/CAAIS/main/CAAIS.sh && chmod +x CAAIS.sh
```
After you do that, you need to actually run this script:
```
  sudo ./CAAIS.sh
```
That's it! Now Chaotic-AUR should be installed in your system. Feel free to remove after the installation (optional).
