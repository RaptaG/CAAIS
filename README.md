# Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script (CAAIS)

</div>

## What's this?
The **Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script** (or _CAAIS_ for short) is a program (written in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)) which installs Chaotic-AUR **automatically** inside your system! It is based on the commands provided by [the Chaotic-AUR website](https://aur.chaotic.cx) and does pretty much everything that is shown there, with some extra options!


## Installation/Usage

### Steps:

1. You need to download the script and make executable and run it:

```
  curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaptaG/CAAIS/main/CAAIS.sh && chmod +x CAAIS.sh
```
2. Run the script:
```
  sudo ./CAAIS.sh
```
That's it! Now Chaotic-AUR should be installed in your system.
