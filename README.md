The **Chaotic-AUR Automated Install Script** (or _CAAIS_ for short) is a program (written in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)) which installs Chaotic-AUR **automatically** inside your system! It is based on the commands provided by [the Chaotic-AUR website](https://aur.chaotic.cx) and does pretty much everything that is shown there, with some extra options!

Chaotic-AUR is, like the AUR (Arch User Repository), availiable only on Arch-based Linux distributions. So, if you try to install it anywhere else, CAAIS will tell that you that it is not possible.

## Installation

### 1. Via the Releases Tab (recommended, stable)

- Enter the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/RaptaG/CAAIS/releases) and download the latest version available and run the following command in the folder you installed CAAIS:

```
chmod +x CAAIS.sh
```

This will make it executable (working).

### 2. By cloning the source code (possibly unstable)

- Open a terminal and run the command below. This will download the script and make it executable:

```
  curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaptaG/CAAIS/main/CAAIS && chmod +x CAAIS
```

## Usage

Open up a terminal inside the folder where CAAIS is installed and run one of the following, according to what you want to do:

```
sudo ./CAAIS -h or --help:            Display the help menu
sudo ./CAAIS -a or --about:           Display info related to CAAIS
sudo ./CAAIS -i or --install:         Download and install Chaotic-AUR
sudo ./CAAIS -r or --remove:          Uninstall Chaotic-AUR
```
